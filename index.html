                    <li>This low awareness level suggests that continued investment in awareness-building campaigns is necessary to move into the "moderate awareness" category (50-70%).</li>
                    <li>The positive trend indicates that current marketing efforts are effective at building awareness, but there is still a substantial portion of the Spanish market that is not aware of Abu Dhabi as a destination.</li>
                    <li>Marketing should maintain awareness-building efforts while increasingly focusing on Spanish-language content to address the top barrier to visitation.</li>

                    <li>The 0.42 elasticity means that for every 10% increase in media impressions, travel queries increase by approximately 4.2%.</li>
                    <li>This indicates that media investments drive travel queries with moderate efficiency.</li>
                    <li>The relationship is positive and slightly stronger than some other European markets (e.g., Netherlands at 0.37).</li>
                    <li>Media campaigns will generate positive ROI but with moderate efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Doubling media spend will not double travel queries, but will produce modest growth.</li>
                    <li>The moderate elasticity suggests that the Spain market is somewhat responsive to media campaigns, but other factors also significantly influence travel decisions.</li>
                    <li>This moderate responsiveness suggests that media investments should be complemented by other marketing approaches, such as addressing specific barriers to visitation, particularly language concerns.</li>
